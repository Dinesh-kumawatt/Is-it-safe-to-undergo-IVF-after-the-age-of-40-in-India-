Yes, it is possibleâ€”and often safeâ€”to go for IVF after age 40 in India, but there are a few important things to know. The safety of the procedure depends on the womanâ€™s overall health, her egg quality, and whether her uterus is ready for pregnancy.

Women over 40 usually have fewer eggs, and the egg quality may not be as good as when they were younger. Thatâ€™s why the chances of a successful pregnancy naturally go down. But with IVF and modern techniques, many women in their early or even mid-40s have had healthy pregnancies.

Doctors might suggest some special options like:

Donor eggs (if the womanâ€™s own eggs are not usable)

Blastocyst transfer (transferring embryos on Day 5 for better success)

PGT (Preimplantation Genetic Testing) to check for healthy embryos

Frozen embryo transfer in a calm cycle

As for safety, IVF procedures are quite safe even after 40. But the risk of certain pregnancy complications like high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or miscarriage does go up. Thatâ€™s why close monitoring is needed.

Women should also get tested for:

Hormone levels (FSH, LH, AMH)

Thyroid function

Heart and sugar tests (especially after 40)

Even though the success rate may be lower, IVF offers hope to women who could not conceive earlier or want a second child later in life.
